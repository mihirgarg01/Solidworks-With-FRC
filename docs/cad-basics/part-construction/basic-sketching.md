# Basic Sketching

Welcome to part construction! Here, you will learn how to model parts in a 2 dimensional sketch and then use a variety of methods to make them 3d dimensional. This first part focuses on the 2 dimensional sketching part. Here, you will learn how to create shapes, change dimensions of your part, and use other tools to make your creations more complex for your FRC use.

### Lines and Shapes

First, create a sketch by clicking the sketch button, then selecting your desired plane. You can then draw shapes and lines on this sketch. You can use the interface next to the right of the sketch button to choose what kind of shapes and lines you want to make. Typically, you start your sketch based off of the origin, because the origin is a constant stasis point that never changes, making your parts stable.

=== Lines

By clicking L or clicking the line option in the interface shown above, in the top left corner, you can create a line. Simply tap at the starting point, and tap at the ending point. If you click the arrow next to the line option, you get two more options.

Centerline is a line that is for construction. This just means that it isn't really part of the sketch, but instead it's just there for reference. You can put centerlines into your sketch to draw other shapes on it. For example, you can put a centerline that goes a specific angle from the origin and put a circle on it for alignment. The midpoint line pretty much means that first spot where you click is the midpoint of your new line. As you move your cursor you create a line that goes both ways. 

Next, circles. With the classic circle, you can simply click the center and move your cursor out which sets the radius. For the perimeter circle, you select 3 points which define the perimeter of the circle. 

Next is splines. You select a series of points, and a curvy line follows the points.

On the next row, there are rectangles. Out of all of the options, the first two are the most important. There is a corner rectangle, where you can select a corner of the rectangle and expand to make it larger. Then, there is the center rectangle, where you select the center of the rectangle and move your cursor outwards to make the diagonal longer. 

For arcs, we have first the centerpoint arc. This is an arc where you select the center of a circle, then move your cursor outwards to select the radius of the circle, then move side to side to get arc length. Then, there is the tangent arc, in which you can create an arc along the ends of lines to connect them with an arc that is tangent to both of the lines. A little trick you can use for tangent arc is to hover over a lines endpoint, trace a line outwards and double back onto the endpoint allowing you to create a tangent arc. Then, there is the three point arg, where you select the starting point, end point, and a middle point of the arc. 

For ellipses, you select center point, then drag out for the width, then drag out for the length.

For slots, you draw the line, which is the middle of the slot and extend outwards to get the curvy part of the slot that gives it area. 

For polygons, you denote a circle and the polygon is circumscribed in it. You can choose number of sides. 




Although it may look like you are drawing in 3 dimensions, keep in mind that everything you draw maps onto the selected plane.
