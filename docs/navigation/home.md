# Basic Solidworks Navigation

## Welcome Dialouge (Home)
The Welcome Dialouge (We call it Home) is the screen you see when you open the Solidworks app. It allows you to create parts/assemblies/drawings, open recent documents, and even has a learning tab (Highly recomend this). The blue box shows what the home menue looks like. If it doesn't show up for you, it can be toggled by pressing the home icon (blue arrow) or by the shortcut `Ctrl + F2`

The options dialouge allows you to access Solidworks's general settings. A lot of them aren't important to FRC, but some are. You can access it by clicking the gear setting icon (Blue Arrow). Access the add-ins menu from the mini arrow (Red Arrow)
