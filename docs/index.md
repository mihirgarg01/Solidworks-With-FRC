# SolidWorks for FRC

## This Project

This is an open source textbook to teach SolidWorks Computer Aided Design for the First Robotics Competition. In this guide we include basic SolidWorks principles and FRC design principles in order to instruct students how to build competitive robots.

## What is SolidWorks?

SolidWorks is a platform for CAD where users can create detailed 3D models. Developed by Dassault Syst√®mes, it is the industry standard of CAD, used by over 45,000 companies. This guide aims to provide a detailed guide to using SolidWorks for FRC activities, not only to motivate competitive, well-planned robots but also to prepare high schoolers for bright careers in engineering and design.

## Who we are

We are FRC team 2854, the Prototypes. Our mission is to provide easy access to education in STEM for students of all ages, so we decided to create this guide of SolidWorks for people in FRC and beyond.
