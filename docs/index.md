# Solidworks with FRC

## This Project

This is an open source textbook to teach SolidWorks Computer Aided Design for the First Robotics Competition. In this guide we include basic SolidWorks principles and FRC design principles in order to instruct students how to build competitive robots.

## Who we are

We are FRC team 2854, the Prototypes. Our mission is to provide easy access to education in STEM for students of all ages, so we decided to create this guide of SolidWorks for people in FRC and beyond.
